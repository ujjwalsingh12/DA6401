Before running the program, ensure that all dependencies are installed; otherwise, errors may occur. A requirements.txt file is provided in the same folder for this purpose.

### Steps to Run the Code:

Download and Extract the Code: Clone or download the repository from GitHub and extract the files.
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project folder and run:

$pip install -r requirements.txt$

Run the Training Script:
Execute the following command:

$python train.py$


* All necessary modules are present in the same folder as train.py, as it imports various classes from different files.
* The code is highly flexible and allows customization through command-line arguments. A list of possible arguments is provided below for reference.
* It is recommended to run the program on a local machine or through the command prompt after verifying that all required libraries are installed. Running it on Google Colab may cause compatibility issues.
