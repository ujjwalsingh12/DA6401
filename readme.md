Before running the program, ensure that all dependencies are installed; otherwise, errors may occur. A requirements.txt file is provided in the same folder for this purpose.

Steps to Run the Code:
	1.	Download and Extract the Code:
Clone or download the repository from GitHub and extract the files.
	2.	Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project folder and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the Training Script:
Execute the following command:

python train.py



Important Notes:
	•	Ensure that all necessary modules are present in the same folder as train.py, as it imports various classes from different files.
	•	The code is highly flexible and allows customization through command-line arguments. A list of possible arguments is provided below for reference.
	•	It is recommended to run the program on a local machine or through the command prompt after verifying that all required libraries are installed. Running it on Google Colab may cause compatibility issues.
